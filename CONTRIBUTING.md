# Contributing to Expensify

Welcome! Thanks for checking out the new Expensify app and for taking the time to contribute!

Suggested change 
## Getting Started
If you would like to become an Expensify contributor, the first step is to read this document in its entirety. Please read the document before asking questions, as it may be covered within the documentation.

## Code of Conduct
This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the Expensify [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to contributors@expensify.com.

## Restrictions
At this time, we are not hiring contractors in Crimea, North Korea, Russia, Iran, Cuba, or Syria.

## Asking Questions
If you have any general questions, please ask in the #expensify-open-source Slack channel. To request an invite to the channel, just email contributors@expensify.com with the subject Slack Channel Invite and include a link to your Upwork profile. We'll send you an invite! Note: The Expensify team will not be able to respond to direct messages in Slack.
If you are hired for an Upwork job and have any job-specific questions, please ask in the GitHub issue or pull request. This will ensure that the person addressing your question has as much context as possible.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities
If you've found a vulnerability, please email security@expensify.com with the subject Vulnerability Report instead of creating an issue.


## Development workflow

To get started with the project, run `yarn` in the root directory to install the required dependencies for each package:

```sh
yarn
```

> While it's possible to use [`npm`](https://github.com/npm/cli), the tooling is built around [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/), so you'll have an easier time if you use `yarn` for development.

While developing, you can run the [example app](/example/) to test your changes. Any changes you make in your library's JavaScript code will be reflected in the example app without a rebuild. If you change any native code, then you'll need to rebuild the example app.

To start the packager:

```sh
yarn example start
```

To run the example app on Android:

```sh
yarn example android
```

To run the example app on iOS:

```sh
yarn example ios
```


Make sure your code passes TypeScript and ESLint. Run the following to verify:

```sh
yarn typescript
yarn lint
```

To fix formatting errors, run the following:

```sh
yarn lint --fix
```

Remember to add tests for your change if possible. Run the unit tests by:

```sh
yarn test
```
To edit the Objective-C files, open `example/ios/KeyCommandExample.xcworkspace` in XCode and find the source files at `Pods > Development Pods > react-native-key-command`.

To edit the Kotlin files, open `example/android` in Android studio and find the source files at `reactnativekeycommand` under `Android`.

- `yarn example start`: start the Metro server for the example app.
- `yarn example android`: run the example app on Android.
- `yarn example ios`: run the example app on iOS.

### Sending a pull request

> **Working on your first pull request?** You can learn how from this _free_ series: [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://app.egghead.io/playlists/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).
When you're sending a pull request:

- Prefer small pull requests focused on one change.
- Verify that linters and tests are passing.
- Review the documentation to make sure it looks good.
- Follow the pull request template when opening a pull request.
- For pull requests that change the API or implementation, discuss with maintainers first by opening an issue.
